All of these designs will work, however, the ones labelled "(OLD)" are projects which hit a dead end or were replaced with other designs.

Designs which were replaced by different designs as part of the same project will have "(Version #, OLD)" in the title. Only the version with the greatest number is currently up to date. 

ALl designs with "BEC" in the title are part of the Autonomous UAV project.
